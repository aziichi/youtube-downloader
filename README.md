# A simple Youtube video and audio downloader

### It is a command line downloader built on top of pytube module.

I have plans to add more features to it like batch downloads and downloading an entire playlist. Let's see if they become a reality ðŸ˜œ

Also don't be shy to add something of your own to this project and contribute to it.
